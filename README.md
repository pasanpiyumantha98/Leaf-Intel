ðŸŒ¿ Leaf Intel
Leaf Intel is an AI-powered tea leaf quality analysis and supplier management platform designed to bring intelligence and transparency to the tea supply chain. Leveraging machine learning and image classification, Leaf Intel helps tea producers, graders, and buyers assess leaf quality instantlyâ€”empowering better decisions, improving consistency, and ensuring fair trade practices.



This project contains all the project files for Leaf Intel, structured into three main directories:

front/ â€“ Contains all frontend components, built using modern web technologies to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.

back/ â€“ Includes the backend implementation, managing API routes, database interactions, authentication, and server-side logic.

model/ â€“ Houses the trained machine learning model used for tea leaf classification, along with Python configurations and FastAPI setup for local hosting and inference.
